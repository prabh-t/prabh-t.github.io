Version History
---------------
Version 4 Set.hs
- looked at Haskell's set source to find an answer for keeping a tree structure balanced. Set uses weight balanced tree.

Version 3 RedBlack.hs
- looked at red-black tree implementation for keeping tree balanced but seems tricky to adapt the code in order to add elements on the leaves only.

Version 2 BinTree_v2.hs
- store more than one element on each tree leaf, to reduce the tree height.

Version 1 BinTree_v1.hs
- simple binary leaf tree representation of list.
